# Intro to VS Code
Dive into the world of efficient coding with our upcoming VS Code workshop, tailored specifically for align students looking to streamline their development process. Learn how to customize your coding environment with powerful extensions, debug with ease, and collaborate in real-time with your peers, all within one of the most popular code editors available today.
# Why VS Code?
VS Code has become a pivotal tool in today's programming environment due to its versatility, efficiency, and broad support for programming languages and development tools. It bridges the gap between a lightweight text editor and a full-fledged Integrated Development Environment (IDE), providing developers with a highly customizable platform that can be tailored to fit almost any development workflow. With its extensive library of extensions, it allows programmers to add just about any functionality they need, from language-specific syntax highlighting and code completion to advanced debugging and version control integration.

In summary:
- Versatile: Supports a wide range of programming languages and tools.
- Efficient: Combines the simplicity of a text editor with the power of an IDE.
- Customizable: Extensive library of extensions for personalized development environments. (They have an unbeatable selection of extensions)
- Community Supported: Strong open-source community for continuous updates and support.
- Trend-Compatible: Stays current with the latest technologies and programming practices.
- Lightweight: this is small download (< 200 MB) and has a disk footprint of less than 500 MB (compared to Intellij and Eclipse carry a much heavier memory footprint).
